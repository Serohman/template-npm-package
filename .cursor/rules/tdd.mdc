# Mandatory Test-Driven Development
- Features/fixes require TDD.
- Tests precede code.
- Completion = all tests pass (`npm test`).

## AI Agent Test Coverage:
- List test cases (functionality, edges, failures) before coding.
- Write/update tests for each case first.
- Document test coverage mapping to requirements (before implementation).
- No coding with incomplete critical test coverage.
- For each change:
  - List test scenarios.
  - Write all tests.
  - Implement logic.
  - Ensure all tests pass for completion.

**Note**: Strict adherence to order and all steps is mandatory for every change. No skipping or combining.
